# Bob's Repository of Bioinformatics Training Knowledge
This respository is simply a collection of links, tutorials, code, presentations, etc. to help students, biologists, or anyone interested in learning basic bioinformatic skills. In all reality, having a basic complement of bionformatic skills is an ___absolute necessity___ to be a successful, productive, and useful biologist in the future.  No matter the field of biology, datasets are getting larger and more complex, along with the tools to process them.  The following is organized into a set of loosely defined "_Modules_" based on what helped me successfully learn these skills as well as teach them.  So, please utilize, share, or critique this collection.  I attempt to update it whenever I have time, and am always welcome to suggestions.  Enjoy!

### Module 1: If you are asking "Why should I even learn this stuff?"
- I recommend you start by reading some of these publications that illustrate the importance of bioinformatics and computational biology
  - [All biology is computational biology](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2002050) by Florian Markowetz
  - [Progress in bioinformatics and the importance of being earnest](https://doi.org/10.1016/s1387-2656(02)08003-1) by TK Atwood and CJ Miller
  - [Bioinformatics - a new era](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-7799(98)00125-5) by Mark Boguski
  - [Bioinformatics programs are 31-fold over-represented among the highest impact scientific papers of the past two decades](./pdf/Wren-2016.pdf) by Jonathan D. Wren
  - [Thriving in multidisciplinary research: advice for new bioinformatics students](./pdf/Auerbach-2012.pdf) by Raymond K. Auerbach
  
  
### Module 2:  The basics of the Unix Shell and an introduction to the "command line interface" (CLI)
- What is the Unix Shell??
  - [Youtube videos by Greg Wilson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3iNcBtycaQ)
  - [One of my powerpoint lectures](./pdf/Fitak_GWD2019_CommandLine.pdf) by Bob Fitak
  - [Introduction to the Unix CLI](./exercises/command-line-tutorial.md) tutorial, by Bob Fitak, uses a basic BASH terminal on a Mac
- Complete introductory Unix CLI training tutorials/courses
  - [Another short beginner's tutorial](https://dbsloan.github.io/TS2018/exercises/unix_commands.html)
  - [A good set of tutorials](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)
  - [Highly recommended tutorials for beginners to novice, complete with graphics](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
- Cheat Sheets of Unix Commands!!!!
  - [cheat sheet 1](./pdf/cheatsheet1.pdf)
  - [cheat sheet 2](./pdf/cheatsheet2.pdf)
  - [cheat sheet 3](./pdf/cheatsheet3.pdf)

### Module 3:  Basic program installation.... every bioinformatician's headache!


### Module 4:  Simple processing of genetic data on the CLI
- First... you must learn how to "grep" (pattern matching)
  - [An introduction to grep](https://informatics.fas.harvard.edu/short-introduction-to-grep.html) by Harvard Informatics
- Bioinformatic One-Liners
  - [Stephen Turner](./exercises/one-liners.md)
  - [Ming Wang](./exercises/one-liners2.md)
  - [Bob Fitak](./exercises/bobs-one-liners.md)
  
### Module 5:  Working with next-generation sequencing (NGS) data (cleaning, processing, mapping, assembling, etc)


### Module 6:  R
- [An absolute beginner's introduction using R Studio](./exercises/intro_R.md) - made by your's truly for a quick teachinng moment
- [R Cheatsheet](./pdf/Rcard.pdf)
  - I used this cheatsheet ___ALL THE TIME___ when I was first learning to use R
- [A Guide to Plotting in R](./pdf/R-plotting.pdf)
  - if you plan on making lots of nice figures for publications, refer to this guide!
- [Quick R](http://www.statmethods.net/) - I used iy quite a bit for learning the basics
- [R Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/) - I never used it but it comes highly recommended
- Full R courses, online and FREE :)
  - [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/): “swirl teaches you R programming and data science interactively, at your own pace, and right in the R console”
  - [HarvardX Biomedical Data Science Open Online Training](http://rafalab.github.io/pages/harvardx.html)
  - [One Page R](https://togaware.com/onepager/) by Togaware
  - [The R programming class on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/rprog), taught by Roger Peng, Jeff Leek and Brian Caffo
  - [The Data Science Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/course/datascitoolbox) class on Coursera, taught by the instructors above.
  - [Code School’s free try R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/) class  (__free with trial__)
